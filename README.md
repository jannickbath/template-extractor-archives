# Template Extractor Archives

This Repository is a collection of predefined templates. You can download the `archives/` and use them locally with the [Template Extractor Tool](https://gitlab.lupcom.de/jbath/template-extractor).

This way you compile your directory into an archive:

```bash
npm run build --dir=yourDirectoryName
```
> Only supports typescript files at the moment.
